-> Simple game:
    -> Generate successors
    -> Write a cost function
    -> Perform expectiminimax with alpha-beta pruning, limit it with some depth
    -> return the move with the least cost

-> Generating successors:
    -> get the next piece
    -> Perform all moves
    -> drop it

-> Write a cost function:
    -> https://hal.inria.fr/hal-00926213/document

-> Expectiminimax problems:
    -> Bubble up the path correctly
    -> Perform the move to the successor state correctly
    -> Look at how the pieces fall instead of all successors

-> Utility function
    -> Height of all cols (mean and max)
    -> Deepest well
    -> 
Generate weights for genetic algorithm
Arrange Utility functions in priority

Problem: Not a high score., max is around 15.
